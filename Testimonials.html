            <p>Taylor Lippman is an incredible life coach! He has helped me change my life for the better and I am forever grateful 
                for his time and energy that he put into our meetings. I have brought Taylor many of my life's challenges, and he has 
                helped me tackle some serious insecurities and doubts. He works with his clients in such a way where the client is given 
                the opportunity to reassess where they are and where they want to be in life. With his help, I feel as if I am generating
                 the goals I want to reach and can see real improvements. I have a more positive outlook on life and have better tools that
                  I can use in the future when I am faced with new obstacles. He works with your best interest in mind, and genuinely wants 
                  to help you improve your satisfaction in life! I would recommend Taylor Lippman as a life coach to anyone who is looking for deeper meaning, more satisfaction, and a higher sense of purpose in their lives.
