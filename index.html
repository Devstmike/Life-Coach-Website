        <h1>What Does a Life Coach Do?</h1>
        <p>A life coach encourages and guides clients on a range of professional and personal issues. Life coaches help you uncover the information about yourself that you never knew existed or that you have never felt comfortable sharing with others.</p>
        <p>During the process, we will analyze and break down your current situation, discover limiting beliefs, identify any blocks and obstacles you are facing, and build a plan of action to help you access the outcomes and life that you crave.</p>
        <p>A life coach won’t force any diagnosis or “cure all” answer. As a client, you get the full opportunity to discover what it is you want to change or enhance in your life, and how to do it in ways that work for you.</p>
        <p>The life coaching approach is not giving advice, consulting, counseling, mentoring and therapy. A coach is more action-oriented and would be hired to help with personal and professional projects, goals and/or transitions.</p>
