                <h1>Hi, i'm Michael</h1>
                <p>I am a Certified Life Coach who provides my clients MASSIVE results through proven strategies and approaches
                   to help them shift their mindsets, get out of their own way, and create deep fulfillment in their personal or 
                   professional lives. I am actively coached through Tony Robbins’ Results Coaching, and was certified as a Life
                   Coach through the internationally accredited Life Purpose Institute. During this process I underwent 60+ hours
                   of coach specific training and exercises to form the right strategies and processes to helping people build and live a life with purpose.
                </p>

        <p class="lineHeight">I wanted to expand beyond just life coaching when I began building my business, and that’s exactly why I’ve built a team of powerhouse coaches ranging from life coaching,
           financial coaching, and hypnotherapy services (Click here to learn more about my coaching services)!
        </p>
        <p class="lineHeight">
            Through the process of coaching, I’ve had the privilege to speak with international communities, work with individuals to help them unlock their true potential, and even build
             a life with purpose on my own – knowing that I am living in a consistent pursuit of my own potential. 
        </p>
        <p class="lineHeight">
            I truly coach because I love helping people live a life where they can wake up every day with the feelings of confidence, purpose, joy and clarity for the outcomes they get to set forth and create in their lives.
            Outside of coaching, you can catch me surfing down in Southern California, hammocking by the beach with a good read in-hand, attempting to be a top-baking chef on my Instagram stories, getting active at the gym or outdoors, 
            and spending quality time with friends, family, and my faith!

        <h1>WHY I GIVE BACK</h1>
        <p class="lineHeight">I am currently giving back 7% of every purchased coaching package to the Huntsman Cancer Institute. Cancer is a disease which has affected so many of us, and I am passionate to help get rid of it with your help. 
            According to the American Cancer Society, “Estimated numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in 2019… [are] 1,762,450 new cancer cases diagnosed and 606,880 cancer deaths in the United States.”
            This disease has claimed the lives of too many. Including one of my fraternity brothers, a member of my youth group, and if not caught early enough, possibly my mother. It’s a very real, and incredibly scary thought, that “I might get cancer”.
             Now, that’s not to say I don’t have an incredibly optimistic view on life, but I try to be realistic with myself as well. Recognizing how this disease doesn’t seem to stop only makes me want to help put an end to it that much more. I hope you’re
            in this with me to help eradicate this disease. You can always donate right here as well! “Huntsman Cancer Institute’s mission is to understand cancer from its beginnings, to use that knowledge in the creation and improvement of cancer treatments,
             to relieve the suffering of cancer patients, and to provide education about cancer risk, prevention, and care.”</p>
